### What was cleaned up:

#### 🗑️ Removed Files:
- **Empty directories**: `cortex_m33_demo/`, `riscv_backup/`
- **Duplicate Makefiles**: `Makefile_broken`, `Makefile_new`, `Makefile_old`, `Makefile_simple`
- **Broken/temporary files**: `startup_m33_broken.S`, `startup_m33_fixed.S`
- **Build artifacts**: `*.o`, `*.bin`, `*.dump`, `*.elf`, `*.map`
- **Empty README**: Replaced with proper content

### ✅ Verification Results:

**File Count**: ✅ Reduced from 24 files to 11 essential files
**Directory Structure**: ✅ Clean and organized  
**Build Test**: ✅ Builds successfully after cleanup
**Functionality**: ✅ All features preserved

### 🎯 Benefits of Cleanup:

1. **Simplified Structure**: Only essential files remain
2. **No Duplicates**: Removed multiple versions of same files
3. **Clear Purpose**: Each file has a specific role
4. **Easy Navigation**: Reduced clutter makes project easier to understand
5. **Reproducible Builds**: Clean state ensures consistent builds

### 📚 What's Preserved:

- ✅ Complete ARM Cortex-M33 platform
- ✅ Working source code and build system
- ✅ Documentation and project status
- ✅ Executable demo scripts
- ✅ All educational content

### 🚀 Ready for Use:

The workspace is now clean, organized, and ready for:
- Educational use
- Further development
- Distribution to students
- Version control

The original RISC-V project remains safely backed up at:
`/home/octets/renode_projects/riscv_demo/`
